# Which "Lower Arm" do you have?

## VERSION 1

> let's have an overview of the mechanical CAD from different view angles.

| Left Forearm V1                                | Right Forearm V2                                |

WHAT NEXT?

You need to identify which cable is broken

### <u>Rules of Thumb:</u>

> 1 - Visual inspection (remove the covers - around the forearm and above the hand - and check for broken cables)
>
> 2 - Identification (which part needs to be repaired)
>
> 3 - Cleaning and Removing the broken cable
>
> 4 - HOWTO GUIDE (follow the instructions from this webpage)

## HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM VERSION 1

### Distal Joints:

There are 2 types of distal Joint on this version of the forearm:

* The ones which goes inside a motor shaft to get anckored and by having the motor spin the cable roll around the pulley and close the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ :

  > Thumb, Index & Middle distals

* The ones which are attached to the slidder

  > Pinky and Ring Fingers

Where are those cables located?

For a Right forearm Version #1

| Thumb distal                                                 | Index and Middle distal                                      | Pinky and ring fingers                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |

| <u>easy to find:</u> no **slider** above or hiding it. It is also tight next to the motor with the cage | they are located beneath the slider                          | They are attached to the slider moving part   |

> <u>WATCH OUT:</u> for the Left forearm - the motor positions are "mirrored" compared to the Right one.
