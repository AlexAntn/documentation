## Distal Joints

There are 2 types of distal Joint on this version of the forearm:

* The ones which go inside a motor shaft to get anchored and as soon as the motor is spinning the cable rolls around the pulley and close the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ :

  > Thumb, Index & Middle distals

* The ones which are attached to the slider

  > Pinky and Ring Fingers

### Where are those cables located?

| <img src ="../img/index_middle_V1.png" height=300 width=auto> | Index and Middle | they are located **<u>beneath</u>** the slider               |
| <img src ="../img/R&P_V1.png" height = 300px>                | Ring and Pinky   | they are attached to the slider moving part                  |

> <u>WATCH OUT:</u> for the Left forearm - the motor positions are "mirrored" compared to the Right one.
