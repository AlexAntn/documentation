## 1.     Basic Principles

 

In the following document we describe how to connect the hand joints with the motors positioned in the forearm. The basic scheme is very simple and based on the following ideas. 

−    Each motor rotates a pulley (P)

−    A (optionally coated) cable is twined around the pulley. The cable is fixed to the pulley by passing through a hole in the pulley (H).

−    The cable exits the motor by passing trough holes H1 and H2.

−    The cable enters into a tube (T1, T2, T3, T4) which guides its path trough the wrist. All the tubes are positioned on suitable sockets in correspondence of the holes (H1, H2).

−    Optionally the cable passes trough tensioners (Te1 and Te2) in between T1/T2 and T3/T4. Again the tensioners are provided with suitable sockets.

−    The cable exits the tube by entering into holes H3 and H4 once more equipped with suitable sockets for the tubes.

##  2.     General Rules to be Followed

<img src ="../img/hand/Fig_2-1.PNG" height = 300px> 

When mounting cables, pay attention to the fact that      rotating the motor in a clockwise direction should correspond to a closure      of the finger. The definition of clockwise rotation is given in the      picture. This rule is valid for all joints but distal joints; in the case      of distal joints the closure of joints depends on some issues that will be      discussed later on.






## 3.     General Tips and Tricks

 

−    The uncoated cable is a bundle of smaller wires. When the cable is cut, this bundle may be corrupted (especially at the cable ending) by trying to pass the cable trough holes. A drop of glue on the cable ending may be useful.

−    Ideally the cable should be twined around the pulley P (see Figure 1‑3) exactly at the middle of it. In particular, when the joint is in the middle of its range of movements the cable should leave the pulley P exactly at the level of the holes H1 and H2 (see Figure 1‑2). If this is not the case, the friction of the cable at the level of H1 and H2 may break the cable after short usage.

−    Always check that the tubes are inside their sockets. If this is not the case cables will break easily due to high friction in correspondence of the input and output holes.

−    The tension of the cable is fundamental for having fingers working correctly. Always consider the possibility of using tensioners for increasing the cable tension.

1. Take a piece of non coated cable (more or less 40cm).
2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley.      Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of      cyanoacrylic glue into the hole.
3. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around      the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes      (H1 and H2): the cable should enter the holes tangentially.
4. Insert the cable extremities, E1 and E2, in holes H1 and      H2 respectively.
5. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Pass E2 trough T2. Position      the extremities of the tube on the sockets of the holes H1 and H2 in the      motor support. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in      its socket.
6. Pass E1 trough the tensioner and insert the tube T1      extremity in one of the tensioner socket. Pass E2 trough the tensioner and      insert the tube T2 extremity in one of the tensioner socket.
7. Pass E1 trough the tube T3. Pass E2 trough T4.
8. Pass E1 trough H3. Pass E2 trough H4. Position the      extremities of T3 and T4 on the sockets in correspondence of H3 and H4.
9. Put the thumb opposition in its fully extended limit.      Twine E1 around the pulley P1. Pass the cable ending E1 trough the hole H6      and exit from H5. Tension the cable by pulling E1 strongly. Check that all      the tube extremities are inside their sockets. Pass the cable ending E2      trough the hole H7 and exit from H5. Tension the cable pulling E2. Note: if inserting the cable into H6 and H7      results difficult, the thumb should be removed from the palm by unscrewing      S3 and S4. Additionally after this operation the pulley P1 can be made      more accessible by rotating it around the spindle Pin1.
10. Maintain the thumb opposition in its fully extended limit.      Pull E2 (the part of the tendon actuating the thumb opposition extension)      and block the cable on the joint with the screw S2. Note: do not block the cable with the screw S1.
11. Increase the cable tension with the help of the motor.      First try understand in which direction the motor should rotate to extend      the thumb. Rotate the motor in this direction by applying an increasing      voltage up to 5V. Since the thumb was already fully extended you should      not observe any evident movement. The only effect of this procedure is to      increase the tension of one side of the cable. Maintain the 5V until the      system is stationary.
12. Pull E1 in order to give tension to the other side of the      cable. While pulling block the cable with S1. 
13. Remove the power supply from the motor thus observing the      tension distributing equally on both sides of the cable.

18. Tension the cable E2 by pulling the cable ending. Check      that the tube is inside its sockets at H4, H5 and H6. Block the cable with      the screw S10, S11 and S12.

 



!!! TIP
    

    Tensioning the cable is very important. Even when all the screws are not tight, it may results difficult to tension the cable in all its parts. This is due to the sharp edges of the pulley which do not allow a uniform distribution of the tension.

Take a piece of coated cable (more or less 40cm).

1. Tie in a knot at the extremity E2 of the cable.
2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley (P). 
3. Pass the cable trough the hole H1 of the motor support.      Position the knot at the extremity E2 on its socket S1 which is positioned      on the pulley P.
4. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Note: the tube extremity      should be inserted correctly in its socket.
5. Pass E1 trough the hole H2. Position the tube extremity on      its socket in H2.
6. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P1 (see      the detailed picture). 
7. Pass E1 trough the hole H3 and exit trough the hole H4.
8. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P2 (see      the detailed picture).
9. Pass E1 trough the hole H5 and exit trough the hole H6. Note: the hole H6 is on a piece of metal that was      designed to be mounted with strain gauges in order to measure the cable      tension.
10. Pull the extremity E1 and be sure that all tubes extremity      are all inside their sockets.
11. Tie in a knot at the extremity E1 as close as possible to      the hole H6.
12. Rotate the motor and check that the finger extension works      correctly. Note: sometimes the finger      extension does not work properly because of the cable friction in      correspondence of the pulleys P1 and P2.

!!! TIPS
     The knot of the finger proximal joint movement may increase the friction in correspondence of the cable at the position where the cable exits the hole H2. Always check that this is not the case.
    The joint can be moved by rotating the motor either in a clockwise or in a counter clock wise direction. However, only one of the two directions will correspond to a correct alignment of the cable with the hole H1. Always check that the cable is working properly (see pictures below: gray cable=correct, red cable= wrong) and that the motor rotates in the correct direction to close the finger(green=correct closure rotation, red = wrong closure rotation).
    The motor housing has two different holes (H1 and H1bis) which can be potentially used. Choose the one that will not be closed by the forearm support when the motor will be mounted.

This join differs from the others since its movement is realized with a slider. The motor rotates so as to move the slider (clockwise rotations correspond to moving the slider proximally, i.e. closer to the elbow). The slider pulls a couple of wires so as to close the ring and little fingers. 

 

Let's first describe how to mount the cables that will move the slider mounted on the forearm.

1. Take a piece of non coated cable (more or less 40cm).
2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley.      Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of      cyanoacrylic glue into the hole.
3. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around      the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes      (H1 and H2): the cable should enter the holes tangentially.
4. Insert the cable extremities, E1 and E2, in holes H1 and      H2 respectively.
5. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Pass E2 trough T2. Position      the extremities of the tube on the sockets of the holes H1 and H2 in the      motor support. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in      its socket.
6. Pass E1 trough the tensioner Te1 and insert the tube T1      extremity in one of the tensioner socket.
7. Pass E1 trough the tube T3.
8. Pass E1 trough H3 and H4. Pass E2 trough H5. Position the      extremities of T3 and T4 on the sockets in correspondence of H4 and H5.
9. Pass E1 trough H6 and E2 trough H7.
10. Pull the extremity E1 and check that all the tubes are      inside their sockets. Tie in a knot (on the cable side E1) at the level of      the hole H6. Rotate the motor in a clock wise manner so as to move the      slider closer to the elbow. In order to increase the cable tension rotate      the motor with an external power supply (more or less 5V) always in a      clock wise direction.
11. Pull the extremity E2 and check that all the tubes are      inside their sockets. Tie in a knot at the level of the hole H7. This knot      should be done as close as possible to the hole H8.
12. Remove the external power supply.

 

Let's now describe how to set up the cables that will pull the tendons that close the fingers thanks to the slider movements.

1. Take a piece of coated cable (more or less 15cm). Tie in a      knot at one extremity. Pass the other extremity (E1) trough the hole H8.      and pull it so as to  move the knot      on H8. -- Take a second piece of coated cable. Tie in a knot at one      extremity. Pass the other extremity (E2) trough the hole H9. and pull it      so as to  move the knot on H9.
2. Pass E1 trough the hole H10. -- Pass E2 trough the hole      H11.
3. Insert E1 trough the tube T4. Position the tube extremity      on the socket in H10. --Insert E2 trough the tube T5. Position the tube      extremity on the socket in H11.

 

Let's now restrict to one of the two fingers (either pinky or ring). Similar operations should be repeated for the other finger.

 

1. Pass E1 trough the hole H12. Position the tube extremity      on its socket in H12.
2. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P1 (see      the detailed picture).
3. Pass E1 trough the hole H13 and exit trough the hole H14.
4. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P2 (see      the detailed picture).
5. Pass E1 trough the hole H15 and exit trough the hole H16.
6. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P3 (see      the detailed picture).
7. Pass E1 trough the hole H17 and exit trough the hole H18. Note: the hole H18 is on a piece of metal that      was designed to be mounted with strain gauges in order to measure the      cable tension.
8. Pull the extremity E1 and be sure that all tubes extremity      are all inside their sockets.
9. Tie in a knot at the extremity E1 as close as possible to      the hole H16.
10. Rotate the motor and check that the finger extension works      correctly.
