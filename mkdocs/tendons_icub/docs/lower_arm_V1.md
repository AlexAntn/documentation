# HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM or HAND - VERSION 1

### <u>Rules of Thumb:</u>

> 1 - Visual inspection (remove the covers - around the forearm and above the hand - and check for broken cables)
>
> 2 - Identification (which part needs to be repaired)
>
> 3 - Cleaning and Removing the broken cable



## Distal Joints

There are 2 types of distal Joint on this version of the forearm:

* The ones which go inside a motor shaft to get anchored, and as soon as the motor is spinning the cable rolls around the pulley and close the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ :

  > Thumb, Index & Middle distals

* The ones which are attached to the slider

  > Pinky and Ring Fingers

### Where are those cables located?

| WHERE                                                        | JOINT            | POSITION                                                     |

| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/index_middle_V1.png" height=300 width=auto> | Index and Middle | they are located **<u>beneath</u>** the slider               |
| <img src ="../img/lowerArm/R&P_V1.png" height = 300px>       | Ring and Pinky   | they are attached onto the moving part of the slider         |

!!! warning "WATCH OUT"
    FOR the **Left forearm** : the motor positions are "mirrored" respect to the **right** ones.



### Let's start recabling

The minimum requirement to start recabling:

| IITCODE | Alias    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2391    | U7194561 | Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x19mm, nom. dia 0.45mm, outer dia 0.61mm, Polyamide coated, AISI 316 - CARL STAHL GMBH |

!!! note "step by step guide for a good knot"

> Start by cutting one piece of 40cm from the cable IITCODE 2391.

> Make a knot at one extremity.

<img src='../img/lowerArm/knot1.jpg' width =400>

> use 2 pliers to close it hard.

<img src="../GIF/lower_arm/knot_video.gif" width = 400>

> drop a tear of glue on the knot and dry it, remove the excess with a tissue - double check that the knot is perfectly dry before to procede.

<img src='../img/lowerArm/knot3.jpg' width = 400>

> cut the excess of cable

##### VIDEO of the closing

> Put a drop of glue on the knot and dry it by removing the excess with a tissue.
> Make sure the knot is perfectly dry and NOT sticky before continuing

##### PHOTO

> insert the cable into the shaft of the motor and pull the cable into it.
> Make sure knot popped into the throat.

### Which distal do I need to restore?

#### <u>Thumb:</u>

Just insert the cable inside the hole. Make sure that 

#### <u>Index or Middle:</u>

You must consider to move the slidder away that covers both motor to be able to see clearly the hole where the cable will go - for that unscrew the 4 screws identicated on the pictures below

#### <u>Ring or Pinky finger:</u>
