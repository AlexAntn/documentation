# HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM or HAND - VERSION 1

### <u>Rules of Thumb:</u>

> 1 - Visual inspection (remove the covers - around the forearm and above the hand - and check for broken cables)
>
> 2 - Identification (which part needs to be repaired)
>
> 3 - Cleaning and Removing the broken cable



## Distal Joints

There are 2 types of distal Joint on this version of the forearm:

* The ones which go inside a motor shaft to get anchored and as soon as the motor is spinning the cable rolls around the pulley and close the joint. Those motors are <u>*perfectly*</u> identical - only the positions differ :

  > Thumb, Index & Middle distals

* The ones which are attached to the slider

  > Pinky and Ring Fingers

### Where are those cables located?

| WHERE                                                        | JOINT            | POSITION                                                     |

| <img src ="../img/index_middle_V1.png" height=300 width=auto> | Index and Middle | they are located **<u>beneath</u>** the slider               |
| <img src ="../img/R&P_V1.png" height = 300px>                | Ring and Pinky   | they are attached onto the moving part of the slider         |

> <u>WATCH OUT:</u> for the Left forearm - the motor positions are "mirrored" compared to the Right one.



### Let's start recabling

The minimum requirement to start recabling:

| IITCODE | Alias    | Provider        | Description                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2391    | U7194561 | CARL STAHL Gmbh | Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x19mm, nom. dia 0.45mm, outer dia 0.61mm, Polyamide coated, AISI 316 |

What ever type of distal you need to recable  you need to start with cutting one piece of 50cm of the cable IITCODE 2391.

> Make a knot by using 2 pliers at the extremity to firmly close the knot. 

##### VIDEO of the closing

> Put a drop of glue on the knot and dry it by removing the excess with a tissue.
> Make sure the knot is perfectly dry and NOT sticky before continuing

##### PHOTO

> insert the cable into the shaft of the motor and pull the cable into it.
> Make sure knot popped into the throat.

### Which distal do I need to restore?

#### <u>Thumb:</u>

Just insert the cable inside the hole

#### <u>Index or Middle:</u>



#### <u>Ring or Pinky finger:</u>
